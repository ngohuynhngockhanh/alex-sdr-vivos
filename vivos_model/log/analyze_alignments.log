The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 25.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 76.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 14.7 hours of data, or 10.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,14.9,48)
